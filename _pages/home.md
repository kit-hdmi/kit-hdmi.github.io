**HDMI (Human-centered Data & Machine Intelligence)** Lab at [Kumoh National Institute of Technology (kit)](https://www.kumoh.ac.kr/ko/index.do?sso=ok) advances next-generation AI that is trustworthy, privacy-preserving, and designed for real-world industrial applications. Our mission is to develop intelligence that understands human needs, learns from high-quality data, and acts safely and effectively in complex environments.

Core Researach Areas:
- **Human-centered AI**: Building trustworthy, safe, and privacy-preserving AI aligned with human values. 
- **Data-centric Intelligence**: Developing robust and efficient machine intelligence through high-quality data and multimodal data.
- **Agentic AI**: Creating autonomous AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, and acting in real-world industrial environments.

Feel free to contact Dr. Choo (schoo@kumoh.ac.kr) if you are interested in joining our lab or collaborating research.
